Determine all the values of n for which one can tile an n × n board so that the number of horizontal and vertical dominoes is the same.


Solution: A required tiling is possible if and only if n is divisible by 4.
If n is odd, the n × n board has an odd number of squares. Therefore, no domino tiling of such a board is possible, because any domino tiling covers an even number
of squares.
If n is divisible by 4, that is, n = 4k, the board can be divided into 4k^2 2 × 2 squares. Since 4k^2 is an even number, one can tile one half of the 2 × 2 squares
with horizontal dominoes and the other half with vertical dominoes to get a desired tiling.
If n is even but not divisible by 4, that is, n = 2m where m is odd, no tiling of an n × n board with an equal number of horizontal and vertical dominoes is
possible. To prove this, we color the board’s rows with two alternating colors. 
Note that any horizontal tile would cover two squares of the same color, and any vertical tile would cover two squares of different colors.
We want to cover the board’s n^2 = 4*m^2 cells with t horizontal tiles and t vertical tiles, where t = m^2. The colored board has 2*m^2 squares of one color and 
2*m^2 squares of the other color. The vertical dominoes would cover m^2 squares of each color, leaving the remaining m^2 squares of each color to be covered by 
horizontal dominoes. But this is impossible for either of the two colors because m^2 is odd whereas the number of squares covered by dominoes must be even.
