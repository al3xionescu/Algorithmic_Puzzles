A researcher puts three types of chameleons on an island: 10 brown, 14 gray, and 15 black. When two chameleons of different colors meet, they both change their 
colors to the third one. Will it be possible for all the chameleons to become the same color ?


Solution: After two chameleons with different colors meet, the number of chameleons of their colors will decrease by 1 and the number of chameleons of the other color
will increase by 2. If we think at the differences between the numbers of the differently colored chameleons, one such difference will not change and the others two 
will increase by 3. So, the division-by-3 remainders of all the three differences will not change. From this, we can see from our initial data that it is impossible
for the chameleons to become the same color. As the initial differences are 1, 4 and 5, the division-by-3 remainders are 1, 1 and 2. But if the chameleons would have
the same color, one difference would be 0, with the division-by-3 remainder 0 as well.
